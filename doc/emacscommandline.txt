INTRODUCTION                                    *emacscommandline*

This plugin makes the command-line mode behave more like the bash command
line, by adding Emacs-style mappings (like in the Bash shell).

MOVEMENT                                        *emacscommandline-movement*

*CTRl-A*         move cursor to beginning of line
*CTRl-E*         move cursor to end of line
*CTRl-B*         move cursor one character backwards
*CTRl-F*         move cursor one character forwards
*META-B*         move cursor one word backwards
*META-F*         move cursor one word forwards

DELETION                                        *emacscommandline-deletion*

*CTRl-D*         delete character under cursor
*CTRl-K*         kill line (delete from character under cursor to end of line)
*CTRl-U*         backwards kill line (delete backwards to beginning of line)
*META-D*         delete word under cursor
*META-Backspace* delete word backwards
*CTRL-W*         delete backwards to next white-space character

HISTORY                                         *emacscommandline-history*

*CTRl-P*         previous line in history
*CTRl-N*         next line in history
*META-CTRl-R*    search history backwards

OTHER                                           *emacscommandline-other*

*CTRl-Y*         paste (yank) last deleted text
*CTRl-_*         undo last change
*CTRl-X_CTRL-U*   "    "    "
*CTRl-Z*         toggle command-line as external command


*WARNING*

This plugin buggers up the expression register (i.e. |c_CTRL-R_=|).  This is
a limitation of vim.  I don't know how to switch these mappings off in the
expression register and I don't think it's possible. However I never use the
expression register except in mappings, so it doesn't affect me.
